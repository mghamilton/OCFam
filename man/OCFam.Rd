\item{ped}{is a data frame with the following columns (class in parentheses):
\itemize{
 \item{'Indiv' (character).}
 \item{'Sire'  (character).}
 \item{'Dam'  (character).}
 \item{'Fam'  (character).}
 \item{'Born'  (numeric).}
 \item{'EBV'  (numeric).}
 \item{'Contbn_count'  (numeric).}
 \item{'AVAIL_BROOD'  (logical).}
}}

\item{indiv_contbn}{is the ...... (numeric between 0 and 1)}

\item{kinship_constraint}{is the ...... (numeric between 0 and 1)}

\item{step_interval}{is the ...... (numeric between 0 and 1)???}

\item{gene_flow_vector}{is a vector ......  as.numeric(NA) if overlapping_gens=FALSE (numeric). For example, gene_flow_vector = c(0.2, 0.8, 0, 0) - Year 4, 3, 2, 1, oldest to youngest}

\item{min_prop_fams}{is the min_prop_parent_fams_to_retain_in_youngest_age_class (numeric between 0 and 1)}

\item{max_parents_per_fam}{is the ...... (integer)}

\item{candidate_parents}{is a data frame with the following columns (class in parentheses):
\itemize{
 \item{'Indiv' (character).}
 \item{'Contbn_count'  (NA if unknown) (numeric). Can Contbn_count and Exclude_max_parents_per_fam be the one column e.g. 0 = fixed contbn NA = no constraint??????? - FIXED_CONTBN}
 \item{'lb'  (numeric). These would be more logically defined as counts - MIN_CONTBN (integers)??????}
 \item{'ub'  (numeric). These would be more logically defined as counts - MAX_CONTBN (integers)??????}
 \item{'Exclude_max_parents_per_fam'  (logical). Could just call this EXCLUDE??????}

'fam_contbn' is a data frame containing details of contributions by family:

 \item{ }
}

'parent_contbn' is a data frame containing details of contributions by individual:

}
\description{
This function generates a mating list for a set of parents.
The mating list can be generated i) to minimise the average inbreeding coefficient (F) of families generated or ii) according to assortative mating principles.
Inputs include a list of parents and a 3-column pedigree file specifying the ancestry of these candidates.
